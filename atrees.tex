	\subsection{Statement}
	Problem is actually
	\href{http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/313/D}{CF313D}
	(did not see that coming).

	\subsection{Solution}
	You can try reading editorial
	\href{http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/7826}{here},
	or 
	\href{http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/7826?#comment-135797}{this}
	comment, or
	\href{http://codeforces.com/contest/313/submission/15502607}{this}
	submission.

	Basically we felt a little lazy, and this would have been annoying
	to typeset; but in case you don't understand solution, please ask
	on backpack, and we will try to write something better.
